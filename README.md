# vSphere REST API

This REST API utilizes the python SDK written by the VMware team and, using Flask, wraps the existing SOAP framework with RESTful calls. This framework also uses the tools found in the community samples the VMware team has also developed. 

# Usage
Place the hostname (or ip) of the VCSA, an admin username, and it's password in a file named "config.json". These will be used for logging into the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA).
